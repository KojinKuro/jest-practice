## Description

This is a repo where I practiced on using Jest. While doing this, I was also practicing using TDD and Red-Green development. The most important thing I learned while doing this project was to test for behaviors over testing methods and classes. We do not need to test for every single function. We only need to test the parts of the application that we interact with on a high level.

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:KojinKuro/jest-practice.git
npm install
npm run test
```

## Context

This project was estimated to take around 3 hours to complete.
